and is diffrerent from that pointer's address,to do something like change the 'variable''s value.
&variable is a operation to get the variable's address.
*pointer is a operation to get the variable's value of pointer's address.Obiviously,only pointer can use * to calculate.
In addition,if we define 'int a' and 'int *p'
